# Idea

## why air filter
* Main route of transmission: droplets/aerosols [rki20](sources.md)
  * Droplets sink rapidly to the ground
  * Aerosols suspended in the air for a long time and dispersed in closed rooms
* German Federal Environmental Agency: shock ventilation in schools every 20 min for at least 3-5 min [uba20](sources.md)
* Similar recommendations for meeting rooms [dguv20](sources.md)
* Disadvantages:
  * Difficult to keep up
  * rooms cool down a lot [kfh20](sources.md)

## targets
* Reduce virus load in indoor air
    * Filter aerosols from the air or render viruses harmless
* Mobile filter system (no built-in system)
* Inexpensive to produce
* Easy to operate
* Little disturbing noise
* Complete air filtration at least 3x per hour.
* For different requirements: Classroom, office, tea kitchen, family event, ...
    * After respective analysis, help at [time20](sources.md)
* Despite air filter, do not underestimate risk of infection.
