## why air filter
* Main route of transmission: droplets/aerosols [rki20]
  * Droplets sink rapidly to the ground
  * Aerosols suspended in the air for a long time and dispersed in closed rooms
* German Federal Environmental Agency: shock ventilation in schools every 20 min for at least 3-5 min [uba20]
* Similar recommendations for meeting rooms [dguv20]
* Disadvantages:
  * Difficult to keep up
  * rooms cool down a lot [kfh20]
